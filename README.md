## Setup (Normal)
Just set https://start.the404.nl/ as your homepage in your browser.

## Setup (Advanced)
Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/the404devs/404-start/releases) and download the latest version (or just `git clone`).

Extract the .zip file to your preferred location, and open `index.html` in your browser. Once you set the URL of this page, you're all set!

## Experimental New Tab Page (Chrome Extension)
*Only supported when 404-Start is a local html file (advanced setup)*

I'm currently working on a Chrome extension that will make this start page your new tab page as well. This feature is still experimental. You've been warned.

In `js/config.js`, change the `ExtPath` variable to the path of `index.html` (You can just copy the url when on the homepage, the 'file://' prefix is required). This path is where the extension redirects the browser upon the creation of a new tab.

To enable the extension, perform the following steps:
- Head over to Chrome's extension settings page **chrome://extensions**.
- Enable "Developer Mode" with the toggle in the top-right corner.
- Hit the "Load Unpacked" button that appears.
- Choose the base directory of the homepage (the one containing `index.html`).
- Success! It should be working now.

- Once the extension is installed, you won't need to update it again, unless explicitly mentioned in the changelog.
- When you update 404-Start, you'll need to set the `ExtPath` variable again.

## OpenWeather API
404-Start uses the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to get weather information. When configuring the weather display, you'll need to provide the ID of the town/city you want to display.

To find this ID, head over to the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) website and search for the town/city you want to display.
You'll find the ID at the end of the page's URL. This is the value you need to put in the 'City ID' field.

## Changelog

### *2.0.2 (12/17/2021)*
------------------------
- Plenty of changes to customization and configuration options.
    - Can now change the spacing between the weather boxes (thanks mom).
    - Slider-ified some config values (`borderRadius`, `weatherBoxMargin`, `boxAlpha`, `headerAlpha`).
    - Can now change the background of the header (colour and transparency).
    - Moved around some of the config options to make more sense.
    - Optimized loading and saving of config from local storage.
    - Added `dataVersion` field to themes, future-proofing for breaking changes.
- Hacky fix to use the unused 'sleet' and 'windy' weather icons.
    - 'Wind' icon is triggered by wind speeds over 30km/h, but I'm no meteorologist.
    - 'Sleet' icon is triggered by checking if the forecast description contains the word "sleet".
- Fixes and such.
    - Restores old config upon failed import of valid non-theme JSON, so we don't accidentally save garbage as our config.
    - More CSS fixes.
    - Workaround for some Firefox-specific CSS issues.
- Made the update-checking more logical.
    - Automatic update checks only happen once per session, not every time the page is loaded (Fix for [#3](/../../issues/3)).
- We only monitor the `404CONFIG` key in local storage for changes, not the entire local storage.
- Refactored `weather.js`, to make it easier to manage, and possibly more efficient.
    - Wind direction is now shown correctly, instead the opposite of where the wind is blowing (See [v1.0.4](#104-04262021)).
    - Wind speed is also shown correctly, because math is hard.
    - Added some documentation on using OpenWeather and finding city ID.
- JS (mostly) documented.
- Moved fonts to `css/fonts/` subdirectory.
- Removed unused `css/sample-colors.css` file.

### *2.0.1 (12/10/2021)*
------------------------
- Reimplemented XKCD comic viewer.
    - Has the same functionality as the old one.
    - May or may not just be identical to the old one.
    - Moves upwards if link section is hidden.
- Added a warning if the selected background image is too large for the browser's local storage.
    - The max size is around 3MB, but I can't be bothered to check.
- CSS fixes.
- Date and time formats are now customizable, with the following expressions:
    - Date:
        - %M - Month (1-12), no leading 0.
        - %MM - Month (1-12), with leading 0.
        - %MMM - Month, abbreviated text ("Jan").
        - %MMMM - Month, full text ("January").
        - %d - Day (1-31), no leading 0.
        - %D - Day (1-31), with leading 0.

        - %Y - Year, full representation ("2021").
        - %w - Weekday, abbreviated ("Fri").
        - %W - Weekday, full representation ("Friday").
    - Time:
        - %h - Hour, 24-hour format.
        - %hh - Hour, 12-hour format, no leading 0.
        - %hhh - Hour, 12-hour format, with leading 0.
        - %m - Minutes.
        - %s - Seconds.
        - %a - AM/PM indicator.

- Fixed a long-standing bug with wind direction arrows pointing in the opposite direction of where they should be.
    - As of 2.0.2 (12/17/2021), I've realized it was actually fine to begin with, and this "fix" made it wrong, lmao.

    - Some documentation changes to match this change.

### *1.0.2 (03/18/2021)*
------------------------

### *1.0.1 (03/13/2021)*
------------------------

        - Button for manual update check
        - Toggle Pywal colours on/off (still need to set the path in `config.js`, for now)
    - Automatic update check on page load. This will probably get annoying, so in the future I should probably make it once per session.

    - Background colour: used for the background of all components
    - Foreground colour: used for text, borders, etc.
    - Highlight colour: used for buttons when hovered over
