# 404-Start
A custom homepage, with **pywal** integration and decent customizability (more soon).

## Setup (Normal)
Just set https://start.the404.nl/ as your homepage in your browser.

## Setup (Advanced)
This is the preferred method of using 404-Start if you want integration with **pywal**, since most modern browsers don't allow remote webpages to read local files, such as pywal's `colors.css`.

Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/the404devs/404-start/releases) and download the latest version (or just `git clone`).

Extract the .zip file to your preferred location, and open `index.html` in your browser. Once you set the URL of this page, you're all set!

For pywal integration: in `js/config.js`, you'll need to change the `Pywal` value to the path to `colors.css` on your system, typically this is `~/.cache/wal/colors.css`.

## Account Creation
Hit the cog icon in the top-right corner, and select *Register*. Insert an email and password and you're good to go!

## Experimental New Tab Page (Chrome Extension)
*Only supported when 404-Start is a local html file (advanced setup)*

I'm currently working on a Chrome extension that will make this start page your new tab page as well. This feature is still experimental. You've been warned.

In `js/config.js`, change the `ExtPath` variable to the path of `index.html` (You can just copy the url when on the homepage). This path is where the extension redirects the browser upon the creation of a new tab.

To enable the extension, perform the following steps:
- Head over to Chrome's extension settings page **chrome://extensions**.
- Enable "Developer Mode" with the toggle in the top-right corner.
- Hit the "Load Unpacked" button that appears.
- Choose the base directory of the homepage (the one containing `index.html`).
- Success! It should be working now.

## About Icons
You can now configure the links on the page, as well as the icons that go alongside them.
Since there is no documentation in the page on how to configure the icons, I'll do it here for now until I come up with a better solution.

You may either use an icon from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/), and set the icon HTML to the provided snippet you'll find on FontAwesome, for example: 

`<i class="fab fa-google"></i>`

Alternatively, you can use your own image, and put in an HTML snippet like this: 

`<img src="img/r.png" class="imageicon">`

Change the `src` value to the path to your chosen image. Make sure you include the `imageicon` class, because that allows the page to filter the image to make it the correct colour. Custom image icons should be square in shape, and black with a transparent background. See the file `img/r.png` for an example.
