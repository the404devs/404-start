# 404-Start
A custom homepage.

## Setup
Head over to the [Releases page](https://github.com/the404devs/404-start/releases) and download the latest version.

Extract the .zip file to your preferred location, and open `index.html` in your browser. Once you set the URL of this page, you're all set!

For Google Chrome users, you can also use this page to override the default new tab page, see below.

## Experimental New Tab Page (Chrome Extension)
I'm currently working on a Chrome extension that will make this start page your new tab page as well. This feature is still experimental. You've been warned.

In `js/config.js`, change the `ExtPath` variable to the path of `index.html`. This path is where the extension redirects the browser upon the creation of a new tab.

To enable the extension, perform the following steps:
- Head over to Chrome's extension settings page **chrome://extensions**.
- Enable "Developer Mode" with the toggle in the top-right corner.
- Hit the "Load Unpacked" button that appears.
- Choose the base directory of the homepage (the one containing `index.html`).
- Success! It should be working now.
