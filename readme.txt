i've included the fonts i've used, obviously you don't have to use them
i've also included a sample colors.css, but if you've used pywal on your system just change the first line in style.css to get use your own colors
it'll also show events from my firebase, so that's a bit of a security issue.
i guess you'll have to make your own and switch out the script block that initializes firebase near the bottom of index.html
if you want to change the weather locations, in weather.js i have two vars containing urls.
in those urls, you'll see a set of coordinates. just change those to wherever you want to have weather from
